### Development process
This project was developed with the Agile methodology which allowed us to develop the app iteratively and incrementally, and adapt changes with flexibility even in the late stages of development.

*GitHub Issues* and *Projects* are used to manage the development process.

The GitHub _Kanban Board_ is used to manage the process and track the progress of the development. When User Story is created, it is automatically added to the Backlog column to be prioritized. The product Backlog is never complete, as it is a dynamic document to respond to changes effectively. As new features are identified, they are added to the product Backlog. As the product is released, the product Backlog is constantly updated to reflect changes in the product and changes in the market. The Kanban board includes the following columns:

- **Product Backlog** - the list of all _User Stories that have not yet been scheduled to be completed. As new User Stories are created, they are automatically added to the Backlog column.
- **Sprint Backlog** - the collection of prioritised User Stories that have been selected for the current Sprint.
- **In Progress** - the user stories that are currently being developed.
- **Done** all completed and tested User Stories.

The *Project Table* is used to filter and prioritize *User Stories*.
At the start of each sprint, the _User Stories_ are selected from the _Product Backlog_ and added to the _Sprint Backlog_ with attached priority labels. The *User Stories* prioritized using the MoSCoW method. The prioritization was based on the following criteria:

- **Must Have** - The *User Story* is crucial and add significant value to the product and must be delivered in the current iteration.
- **Should Have** - The User Story is important but not critical to the success. Simply delivery is not guaranteed within the current iteration.
- **Could Have** - The *User Story* is desirable and would only be delivered in their entirety in a best-case scenario. When a problem occurs and the deadline is at risk, one or more could-have items are dropped.
- **Won't Have** - The *User Story* will not be delivered in the current delivery timebox but may be considered for the future. The prioritization is based on the 60-20-20 rule where 60% of the effort is spent on the *Must Have*, 20% on the *Should Have* and the rest 20% on the *Could Have*.
